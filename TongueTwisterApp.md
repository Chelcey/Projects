# Don't Get It Twisted [Tongue Twister App]

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Class:**  </span> Social Computing

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Objective:**  </span> To design an engaging platform and challenge for users to improve their pronunciation skills by reciting tongue twisters.

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Overview:**  </span> 
This project involved creating an app to engage users to improve their pronunciation skills using tongue twisters. 

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Research and Inspiration:**  </span> 
Conducted online surveys with Students, language learners, gamers (each with varying proficiency levels) to understand more about the challenges faced in learning languages. Analyzed similar apps and tools. 



<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Design Process:**  </span>
  - <span style="color:DarkSlateBlue;"> **Wireframes:**  </span>
    - Designed wireframes showcasing the app's layout, including sign-up, home section, viewer mode, sudden death, and
      profile & leaderboard
    - Emphasized user-friendly design with a clear navigation and easy access to features.
      
  - <span style="color:DarkSlateBlue;"> **Prototypes:**  </span>
    - **Version 1:** Utilitized Discord bots to simulate the app experience but faced technical difficulties and it was
      too complex for the game master
    - **Version 2:** Conducted in-person tongue twister competions with Slido for voting and feedback. This version
      improved on user engagement and interaction.
    - **Version 3:** Final prototype includes a refined design with improved features based on the user feedback, focusing
      on ease of use and real-time engagement.
    
  - <span style="color:DarkSlateBlue;"> **Final Design** </span>
    - The final design utilized user feedback to create an intuitive and enjoyable experience.
    - Features included personalized exercises, live competions, spectator voting, and detailed user profiles.

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Visuals:**  </span>
   - Created wireframes and prototypes showcasing the app's interface and user experience
     
<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Tools & Role:**  </span>
 - <span style="color:DarkSlateBlue;"> **My Role:**  </span>
   - Assisted in background research and created/distributed surveys.
   - Worked on presentation slides and the final portfolio.
   - Aided in developing solutions for prototype interations, including the idea of the analog prototype.
  
 - <span style="color:DarkSlateBlue;"> **Tools Used:**  </span>
  - Figma for wireframes and prototypes.
  - Slido for audience voting and feedback.
  - Google Slides for presentations.
  - Discord for initial prototyping.

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Reflection:**  </span>
  - Iterative design and user feedback were crucial in refining our app.
  - Learned the improtance of simplicity and user-centered design.
  - Prioritized accuracy over seped and ensured the equity in competitions.
  - Transitions from digital to in-person prototyping provided valuable insights into real-world interactions.

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**User Feedback:**  </span>
  - Foudn that the in-person format to be more engaging than the Discord prototype.
  - Enjoyed public speaking and the absence of complex technology.
  - Requested clearer instructions and immediate feedback after each round.
  - Suggested focusing on accuracy versus speed and ensuring fair competition.

<span style="color:MediumBlue;">**Conclusion:**  </span>
  - Our journey highlights the signficance of user engagmeent and iterative design from the conceptualization to in-person
    competitons.
  - Future focus will be refining our approach and utilitizing design methodologies to create successful language learning
    experiences. (focused on physical -> next focus is virtual)
